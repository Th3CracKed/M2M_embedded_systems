As a sample, we provide a simple kernel that only supports an echo console
on the serial line COM1. This is of course just a sample and it is certainly
not a complete kernel.

A very simple program that sets a simple echo console on COM1.
Notice that we did not setup interruptions, so this is an active
polling! Expect to hear your fan ramping up real quick...

crt0.S:
A minimal C-environment initialization (stack and zero'ed bss).

main.c:
Just an echo through the serial line.

serial.c:
Support for serial lines
